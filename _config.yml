description: My name is Jens and I was formerly working as a Coordinator for International Relations (CIR) in Northern Japan but I also have passion for data and programming. I hold a masters degree in philosophy and worked as a research assistant for two professors at Ruhr-University. The focus of my studies and work lay on Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science, which ended up sparking my interest in programming, data and statistics. I acquired skills in Python, SQL, and Excel during my free time mainly via courses on Udemy, YouTube, and a whole lot of online research.
