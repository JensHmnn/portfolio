# Data Analyst Portfolio
Hi, and welcome to my portfolio! 

My name is Jens and I'm currently working as a Coordinator for International Relations (CIR) in Northern Japan but I'm trying to set foot into the world of data analytics.

I hold a master's degree in philosophy and worked as a research assistant for multiple professors at university. The self-chosen focus of my studies lay on Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science, which ended up sparking my interest in programming, data and statistics. But my skills in Python, SQL, and Excel I acquired mostly during my free time mainly via courses on Udemy, YouTube, and a whole lot of online research.

Thank you for your time and interest.
I hope you enjoy my work so far.

## Projects
**Project 1: Freedom and Prosperity**\
<ins>Goal:</ins> Exploring the question whether freedom is not only beneficial for inidivduals but also from a broader, societal erspective.

<ins>Description:</ins> As over recent years freedom seems to be declining worldwide, I was wondering what reasons there are for us to aspire freedom, apart from the individual human desire to live freely. At least from a Western point of view, we usually picture the "free world" as the more advanced and prosperous part of our world. So, in this project I was trying to gain some insight into how freedom and Gross Domestic Products - the most common measure for a country's economic prosperity - are related. 
For this purposed I used two data sets: the first one being the basic "Quality of Government" (QoG) dataset which is compiled and maintained at the University of Gothenburg. I used the QoG-data because this dataset is more accessible than the datasets provided FreedomHouse themselves and gathers a lot of data on other interesting measures from different datasets, which proved interesting for data exploration, even if I did not utilize them for the main part of the project.
However, the GDP data in the QoG-dataset turned out to be somewhat inaccurate as it is based on statistical projections rather than actual data. So, I replaced the GDP data from the QoG-dataset with the data on "GDP per capita, purchasing power parity, current prices" provided by the International Monetary Fund.
Lastly, I summarized the analysis and results in a PowerPoint presentation.

**Project 2: Workout Tracker**\
<ins>Goal:</ins> Create a workout tracker app using Python to store and display data about past workouts.

<ins>Description:</ins> This project is less focused on data analysis, and more on the programming side of things. 

<ins>Skills:</ins> 

<ins>Technology:</ins> Python, matplotlib, PyQt5, Pandas, SQL

**Project 3: Covid 19 Mortality**\
<ins>Goal:</ins> Gaining insights into the mortality of Covid 19 infections worldwide and providing these in an accessible, explorable way.

<ins>Description:</ins> This was my very first project. 
As such, it is originally a follow-along project of Alex the Analyst ([Source 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM), [Source 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QILNlRvJlfQ)). 
However, along the way I had to make a lot of adjustments to avoid errors and other problems that would occur with the original code on my environment.
Also, I tried to add my own ideas onto the original code and Tableau dashboard.

<ins>Skills:</ins> data cleaning; data analysis in SQL; data visualization & dashboard creation in Tableau Public

<ins>Technology:</ins> Python, Pandas, MySQL, Tableau
