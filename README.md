# Data Analyst Portfolio
Hi, and welcome to my portfolio! 

My name is Jens and I'm currently working as a Coordinator for International Relations (CIR) in Northern Japan but I'm trying to set foot into the world of data analytics.

I hold a master's degree in philosophy and worked as a research assistant for multiple professors at university. The self-chosen focus of my studies lay on Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science, which ended up sparking my interest in programming, data and statistics. But my skills in Python, SQL, and Excel I acquired mostly during my free time mainly via courses on Udemy, YouTube, and a whole lot of online research.

Thank you for your time and interest.
I hope you enjoy my work so far.

## Projects
**Project 1: Freedom and Prosperity**\
<ins>Goal:</ins> Exploring the question whether freedom is not only beneficial for inidivduals but also from a broader, societal/economic perspective

<ins>Description:</ins> I was wondering what motivations there could be for us to aspire freedom, apart from every individual human's desire to live freely. So, in this project I was trying to gain some insight into how freedom and Gross Domestic Products - the most common measure for a country's economic prosperity - are related. For this I used two data sets: the first set I used is the "Quality of Government" (QoG) dataset of...
I used the QoG-dataset because this dataset is more accessible than the datasets provided FreedomHouse themselves and gathers a lot of data on other interesting measures from different datasets, which proved interesting for data exploration.
However, the GDP data in the QoG-dataset turned out to be somewhat inaccurate as it is based on statistical projections rather than actual data, even for already passed years. So, I replaced the GDP data from the QoG-dataset by merging it with the data on "GDP per capita, purchasing power parity, current prices" provided by the International Monetary Fund.
