# Jens HÃ¶mann - Data Analyst Portfolio
Hi, and welcome to my portfolio! 

My name is Jens and I'm currently working as a Coordinator for International Relations (CIR) in Northern Japan but I'm trying to set foot into the world of data analytics.

I hold a master's degree in philosophy. The self-chosen focus of my studies lay on Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science, which ended up sparking my interest in programming, data and statistics. But most importantly majoring philosophy taught me a wide variety of skills such as logical and critical thinking, presentation skills, the versatility to quickly gain a thorough grasp of new areas of expertise, and the ability to hold objective discussions with the goal of reaching the most beneficial conclusions.

My skills in Python, SQL, and Excel I acquired during my free time mainly via courses on Udemy, YouTube, and a whole lot of online research.

Working as a CIR in a Japanese environment granted me work experience as a foreigner in Japanese environments, honed my language skills, and improved my presentation skills in a variety of contexts, ...

Thank you for your time and interest.
I hope you enjoy my work so far.
