# Portfolio
Hi, and welcome to my portfolio! 

My name is Jens and I'm currently working as a Coordinator for International Relations (CIR) in Northern Japan but I also have passion for data and programming.

I hold a master's degree in philosophy and worked as a research assistant for two professors at Ruhr-University. The focus of my studies and work lay on Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science, which ended up sparking my interest in programming, data and statistics. I acquired skills in Python, SQL, and Excel during my free time mainly via courses on Udemy, YouTube, and a whole lot of online research.

Thank you for your time and interest.
I hope you enjoy my work so far!

## Projects
**Project 1: Interactive Sales Dashboard (Tableau)**\
<ins>Goal:</ins> Creating an interactive dashboard that represents different sales metrics and trends as well as customer data allowing users to analyze year-over-year sales performance and trends along with customer behavior and trends.

<ins>Description:</ins>

<ins>Technology:</ins> Tableau

**Project 2: Workout Tracker (early version, work in progress) (Python)**\
<ins>Goal:</ins> Creating a workout tracker app using Python to store and display data of past workouts.

<ins>Description:</ins> This project is a little less focused on data analysis in itself, and more on the programming side of things. My goal is to create an app for tracking workouts and utilizing this data to be able to gain various insights. 
This project is still in an early stage. In the future I will add more variety to the types of workouts and the displayable charts. Also I will soon make the automatic calculation of burned calories more accurate by adding workout intensity. The main issue with the current simple way of calculating burned calories is that it is simply inaccurate, as multiple factors influence how many calories are burned in a workout, not just the type of workout and it's length. This issue can also be seen in the visualization of "burned calories over workout duration" when using the provided workout dataset. Solely using on the automatic calculation for burned calories leads to a perfectly linear correlation between burned calories & length of the workout which is frankly unrealistic and to a degree makes the visualization lose its purpose.\
My long term goal is also to replace the entry fields with an AI chatbot that further automates the process of extracting, storing, and analyzing the data. However, as I am just starting off at acquiring skills in AI programming achieving this goal will require some more time. Still I hope that in the tracker in its current state can represent some of my ideas and technical skills.

<ins>Technology:</ins> Python, matplotlib, PyQt5, Pandas, SQL

**Project 3: Freedom and Prosperity (Excel)**\
<ins>Goal:</ins> Exploring the question whether freedom is not only beneficial for inidivduals but also from a broader societal perspective.

<ins>Description:</ins> As over recent years freedom appears to be declining worldwide, I was wondering what reasons there are for societies to aspire freedom, apart from the human desire to live freely. At least from a Western point of view, we usually picture the "free world" as the more advanced and economically prosperous part of our world. So, in this project I was trying to gain some insight into how freedom and Gross Domestic Products - the most common measure for a country's economic prosperity - are related. 
I used two data sets: the first one being the basic "Quality of Government" (QoG) dataset provided by the University of Gothenburg. I used the QoG-data because this dataset is more accessible than the datasets provided FreedomHouse themselves and gathers a lot of data on other interesting measures from different datasets, which proved interesting for data exploration, even if I did not end up using them for the main part of the project.
However, the GDP data in the QoG-dataset turned out to be inaccurate as it is based on statistical projections rather than actual data. So, I replaced the GDP data of the QoG-dataset with the data on "GDP per capita, purchasing power parity, current prices" provided by the International Monetary Fund.
After analyzing the data in Excel using mostly PowerQuery, PowerPivot and pivot tables, I summarized the process and results in a PowerPoint presentation.

**Project 4: Covid 19 Mortality (SQL & Tableau)**\
<ins>Goal:</ins> Gaining insights into the mortality of Covid 19 infections worldwide and providing these in an accessible, explorable way.

<ins>Description:</ins> This was my very first project. 
As such, it is originally a follow-along project of Alex the Analyst ([Source 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM), [Source 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QILNlRvJlfQ)). 
However, along the way I had to make a lot of adjustments to avoid errors and other problems that would occur with the original code on my environment.
Also, I tried to add my own ideas onto the original code and Tableau dashboard, to make the project my own.

<ins>Technology:</ins> SQL (MySQL), Tableau, (Python, Pandas)
